# Codedamn Frontend Assessment

This is a frontend project built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Strapi for the Codedamn Frontend Assessment.

## Description

The project aims to create a modern profile page using the latest frontend technologies. Next.js is used as the frontend framework, which makes it easy to create server-rendered React applications. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, which is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework. The data is stored locally and is used as an API using Next.js api routes.

The profile page has mainly two part: 
1. A profile page where you can see the user details.
2. A profile update page where you can update the user details.

Some parts of the update profile page is not functional which is intentional as they need some good amount of design and functionality descision which I think will take a lot of time.
